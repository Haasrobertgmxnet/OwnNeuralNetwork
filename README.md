### README
A three-layer feed forward neural network is tested using the well-known Iris data set (R. Fisher, 1937). 30 out of the 150 datasets are test data and therefore excluded from training. The four input feature data are scaled as done in the RobustScaler of scikit-learn. The gradient method for backpropagation is simple.
